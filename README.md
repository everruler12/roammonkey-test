# RoamMonkey

Files are live at https://roammonkey-test.vercel.app/

### To Use:

- copy this Roam page https://roamresearch.com/#/app/everruler/page/ADAaJc4Jv into your Roam
- or copy the code from https://github.com/everruler12/roammonkey-test/blob/master/roamjs%20block.js into a javascript code block indented under a `[[roam/js]]` block

### Package Format:

Make sure your files are on a server that serves the correct headers, and have the correct extension (only '.js' and '.css' supported for source and dependencies), otherwise they won't load properly. Vercel is a free way to do this.

### Guidelines

If you use `console.log()` in your script, add your script name so people know which script it's from. Like: `console.log('RoamMonkey: ', data)`

# RoamMonkey

To use, copy this Roam page https://roamresearch.com/#/app/everruler/page/ADAaJc4Jv anywhere in your Roam

Package format:

Make sure your files are on a server that serves the correct headers, and have the correct extension (only '.js' and '.css' supported for source and dependencies), otherwise they won't load properly. Vercel is a free way to do this. Or you can fork...

### Guidelines
If you use `console.log()` in your script, add your script name so people know which script it's from. Like: `console.log('RoamMonkey: ', data)`
